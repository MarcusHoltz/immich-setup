# Docker Compose Delayed Restart and Update Script for Immich
# -----------------------------------
# This script is used to delay an update and restart the 
# Immich photo management stack and then NetBird using Docker.
#
# This file is located at: /boot/config/plugins/user.scripts/scripts/Immich-docker-compose
#
# Steps that are performed:
# 1. Navigates to the Immich Docker Compose project directory.
# 2. Waits 100 seconds before initiating the update (to allow the system to fully settle).
# 3. Stops the current Immich containers.
# 4. Pulls the latest images defined in the Docker Compose file.
# 5. Starts the updated containers in detached mode.
# 6. Waits an additional 60 seconds to allow the containers to fully initialize.
# 7. Restarts the NetBird-Client container, to re-establish VPN connectivity.

# Change to the Immich Docker Compose project directory
cd /boot/config/plugins/compose.manager/projects/immich

# Wait for 100 seconds (e.g., allowing system services to be fully ready)
sleep 100

# Stop and remove current Immich containers
docker compose down

# Pull the latest versions of the container images
docker compose pull

# Recreate and start the containers in the background
docker compose up -d

# Wait 60 seconds to allow the containers to initialize
sleep 60

# Restart the NetBird-Client container, for network service alignment
docker container restart NetBird-Client
